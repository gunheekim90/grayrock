This repo contains Solidity smart contract code for simple, standards-compliant tokens on Ethereum. Adhering to standards allows other contract developers to easily incorporate your token into their applications.

The repo currently implements [ERC20]tokens, and more may be added in the future.

## About Grayrock token

ROCK token is a utility token of the Gray Rock platform, which promotes transactions on the platform and guarantees the stability of the ecosystem by providing benefits such as discounting fees and giving priority. Investors (customers) can get a discount on fees by purchasing more than a certain amount of ROCK tokens and holding them for a certain period of time, and additional discount benefits can be applied when paying fees with ROCK tokens. As the number of users entering the platform increases, the benefits that can be obtained from holding ROCK tokens increase, which in the long term will increase the demand for ROCK tokens. Therefore, the value of the ROCK token increases, which provides both investors and bot developers a continuous economic incentive to participate in Gray Lock.

Additionally, the growth of the cryptocurrency market itself acts as a strong external growth engine for Graylock. Several major coins, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are recognized by the institutional sector, which drives solid growth of the cryptocurrency market. Since the demand from individual investors and bot developers also increases in line with the rise of the market, Gray Rock has secured stable growth potential in the long term.
